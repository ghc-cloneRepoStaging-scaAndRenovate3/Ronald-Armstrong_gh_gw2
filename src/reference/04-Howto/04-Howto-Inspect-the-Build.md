Inspect the build
-----------------

<a name="taskhelp"></a>

### Show or search help for a command, task, or setting

The `help` command is used to show available commands and search the
help for commands, tasks, or settings. If run without arguments, `help`
lists the available commands.

```
> help

  help                         Displays this help message or prints detailed help on 
                                  requested commands (run 'help <command>').
  about                        Displays basic information about sbt and the build.
  reload                       (Re)loads the project in the current directory
  ...

> help compile
```

If the argument passed to `help` is the name of an existing command,
setting or task, the help for that entity is displayed. Otherwise, the
argument is interpreted as a regular expression that is used to search
the help of all commands, settings and tasks.

The `tasks` command is like `help`, but operates only on tasks.
Similarly, the `settings` command only operates on settings.

See also `help help`, `help tasks`, and `help settings`.

### List available tasks

The `tasks` command, without arguments, lists the most commonly used
tasks. It can take a regular expression to search task names and
descriptions. The verbosity can be increased to show or search less
commonly used tasks. See `help tasks` for details.

The `settings` command, without arguments, lists the most commonly used
settings. It can take a regular expression to search setting names and
descriptions. The verbosity can be increased to show or search less
commonly used settings. See `help settings` for details.

<a name="listsettings"></a>

### List available settings

The `inspect` command displays several pieces of information about a
given setting or task, including the dependencies of a task/setting as
well as the tasks/settings that depend on the it. For example,

```
> inspect Test/compile
...
[info] Dependencies:
[info]  Test / manipulateBytecode
[info]  Test / enableBinaryCompileAnalysis
[info]  Test / compileIncSetup
[info] Reverse dependencies:
[info]  Test / products
[info]  Test / discoveredMainClasses
[info]  Test / printWarnings
[info]  Test / definedTestNames
[info]  Test / definedTests
...
```

See the [Inspecting Settings][Inspecting-Settings] page for details.

<a name="taskdependencytree"></a>
### Display tree of setting/task dependencies

In addition to displaying immediate forward and reverse dependencies as
described in the previous section, the `inspect` command can display the
full dependency tree for a task or setting. For example,

```
> inspect tree clean
[info] clean = Task[Unit]
[info]   +-clean / streams = Task[sbt.std.TaskStreams[sbt.internal.util.Init\$ScopedKey[_ <: Any]]]
[info]   | +-Global / streamsManager = Task[sbt.std.Streams[sbt.internal.util.Init\$ScopedKey[_ <: Any]]]
[info]   | 
[info]   +-cleanFiles = Task[scala.collection.Seq[java.io.File]]
[info]   | +-cleanKeepFiles = Vector(<project>/target/.history)
[info]   | | +-history = Some(<project>/target/.history)
[info]   | |   +-target = target
[info]   | |     +-baseDirectory = 
...
```

For each task, `inspect tree` show the type of the value generated by
the task. For a setting, the `toString` of the setting is displayed. See
the [Inspecting Settings][Inspecting-Settings] page for details on the
`inspect` command.

<a name="description"></a>

### Display the description and type of a setting or task

While the `help`, `settings`, and `tasks` commands display a description
of a task, the `inspect` command also shows the type of a setting or
task and the value of a setting. For example:

```
> inspect update
[info] Task: sbt.librarymanagement.UpdateReport
[info] Description:
[info]  Resolves and optionally retrieves dependencies, producing a report.
...
```

```
> inspect scalaVersion
[info] Setting: java.lang.String = 2.12.6
[info] Description:
[info]  The version of Scala used for building.
...
```

See the [Inspecting Settings][Inspecting-Settings] page for details.

<a name="delegates"></a>

### Display the delegation chain of a setting or task

See the [Inspecting Settings][Inspecting-Settings] page for details.

<a name="related"></a>
### Display related settings or tasks

The `inspect` command can help find scopes where a setting or task is
defined. The following example shows that different options may be
specified to the Scala for testing and API documentation generation.

```
> inspect scalacOptions
...
[info] Related:
[info]  Compile / scalacOptions
[info]  Global / scalacOptions
[info]  Test / scalacOptions
```

See the [Inspecting Settings][Inspecting-Settings] page for details.

<a name="projects"></a>

### Show the list of projects and builds

The `projects` command displays the currently loaded projects. The
projects are grouped by their enclosing build and the current project is
indicated by an asterisk. For example,

```
> projects
[info] In file:/home/user/demo/
[info]   * parent
[info]     sub
[info] In file:/home/user/dep/
[info]     sample
```

<a name="session"></a>

### Show the current session (temporary) settings

`session list` displays the settings that have been added at the command
line for the current project. For example,

```
> session list
  1. maxErrors := 5
  2. scalacOptions += "-explaintypes"
```

`session list-all` displays the settings added for all projects. For
details, see `help session`.

<a name="about"></a>

### Show basic information about sbt and the current build

```
> about
[info] This is sbt 1.1.5
[info] The current project is {file:~/code/sbt.github.com/}default
[info] The current project is built against Scala 2.12.6
[info] Available Plugins: sbt.plugins.IvyPlugin, sbt.plugins.JvmPlugin, sbt.plugins.CorePlugin, sbt.plugins.JUnitXmlReportPlugin, sbt.plugins.Giter8TemplatePlugin
[info] sbt, sbt plugins, and build definitions are using Scala 2.12.6
```

<a name="value"></a>

### Show the value of a setting

The `inspect` command shows the value of a setting as part of its
output, but the `show` command is dedicated to this job. It shows the
output of the setting provided as an argument. For example,

```
> show organization
[info] com.github.sbt 
```

The `show` command also works for tasks, described next.

<a name="result"></a>

### Show the result of executing a task

```
> show update
... <output of update> ...
[info] Update report:
[info]  Resolve time: 122 ms, Download time: 5 ms, Download size: 0 bytes
[info]  compile:
[info]      org.scala-lang:scala-library:
[info]              - 2.12.6
[info] ...
```

The `show` command will execute the task provided as an argument and
then print the result. Note that this is different from the behavior of
the `inspect` command (described in other sections), which does not
execute a task and thus can only display its type and not its generated
value.

```
> show compile:dependencyClasspath
...
[info] ArrayBuffer(Attributed(/Users/foo/.sbt/boot/scala-2.12.6/lib/scala-library.jar))
```

<a name="classpath"></a>

### Show the classpath used for compilation or testing

For the test classpath,

```
> show Test/dependencyClasspath
...
[info] List(Attributed(/Users/foo/code/sbt.github.com/target/scala-2.12/classes), Attributed(~/.sbt/boot/scala-2.12.6/lib/scala-library.jar), Attributed(/Users/foo/.ivy2/cache/junit/junit/jars/junit-4.8.2.jar))
...
```

<a name="applications"></a>

### Show the main classes detected in a project

sbt detects the classes with public, static main methods for use by the
`run` method and to tab-complete the `runMain` method. The
`discoveredMainClasses` task does this discovery and provides as its
result the list of class names. For example, the following shows the
main classes discovered in the main sources:

```
> show compile:discoveredMainClasses
... <runs compile if out of date> ...
[info] List(org.example.Main)
```

<a name="tests"></a>

### Show the test classes detected in a project

sbt detects tests according to fingerprints provided by test frameworks.
The `definedTestNames` task provides as its result the list of test
names detected in this way. For example,

```
> show Test/definedTestNames
... < runs test:compile if out of date > ...
[info] List(org.example.TestA, org.example.TestB)
```

## sbt 1.3.x releases

### sbt 1.3.0

This is the third feature release of sbt 1.x, a binary compatible release focusing on new features. sbt 1.x is released under **Semantic Versioning**, and the plugins are expected to work throughout the 1.x series.

The headline features of sbt 1.3 are out-of-box [Coursier](https://get-coursier.io/) library management, ClassLoader layering, IO improvements, and super shell. Combined together we hope these features will improve the user experience of running your builds.

#### Changes with compatibility implication

- Library management with Coursier. See below for details.
- Super shell. See below for details.
- Multi command no longer requires leading semicolon. clean;Test/compile; would work. #4456 by @eatkins
- Deprecates HTTP resolvers, but allow localhost or resolvers marked `.withAllowInsecureProtocol(true)` #4997
- Deprecates `CrossVersion.Disabled`. Please use `CrossVersion.disabled` instead sbt/librarymanagement#316
- ClassLoader management: To prevent resource leaks, sbt 1.3.0 closes the ephemeral ClassLoaders used by the `run` and `test` tasks after those tasks complete. This may cause downstream crashes if the task uses ShutdownHooks or if any threads created by the tasks continue running after the task completes. To disable this behavior, either set `Compile / run / fork := true` or run sbt with `-Dsbt.classloader.close=false`.

#### Library management with Coursier

sbt 1.3.0 adopts [Coursier](https://get-coursier.io/) for the library management. Coursier is a dependency resolver like Ivy, rewritten in Scala by Alexandre Archambault ([@alexarchambault][@alexarchambault]), aiming to be a faster alternative.

**Note**: Under some situations, Coursier may not resolve the same way as Ivy (for example remote `-SNAPSHOT`s are cached for 24 hours). If you wish to go back to Apache Ivy for library management, put the following in your `build.sbt`:

```scala
ThisBuild / useCoursier := false
```

Many people were involved in the effort of bringing Coursier to sbt. Early in 2018 Leonard Ehrenfried ([@leonardehrenfried][@leonardehrenfried]) started the Coursier-backed LM API implementation as [lm#190][lm190]. During the fall, it was further improved by Andrea Peruffo ([@andreaTP][@andreaTP]), and `lm-coursier` eventually became part of coursier/sbt-coursier repository maintained by Alex. This spring, Eugene ([@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]) revisited this again to make a few more changes so we can swap out the LM engine in [#4614][4614] with the help from Alex.

#### Turbo mode with ClassLoader layering

sbt 1.3.0 adds "turbo" mode that enables experimental or advanced features that might require some debugging by the build user when it doesn't work.

```scala
ThisBuild / turbo := true
```

Initially we are putting the layered ClassLoader (`ClassLoaderLayeringStrategy.AllLibraryJars`) behind this flag.

sbt has always created two-layer ClassLoaders when evaluating the `run` and `test` tasks. The top layer of the ClassLoader contains the scala library jars so that the classes in the scala package may be reused across multiple task evaluations. The second layer loads the rest of the project classpath including the library dependencies and project class files. sbt 1.3.0 introduces **experimental** `classLoaderLayeringStrategy` feature that furthers this concept.

```scala
Compile / classLoaderLayeringStrategy := ClassLoaderLayeringStrategy.Flat
// default
Compile / classLoaderLayeringStrategy := ClassLoaderLayeringStrategy.ScalaLibrary
// enabled with turbo
Compile / classLoaderLayeringStrategy := ClassLoaderLayeringStrategy.AllLibraryJars

Test / classLoaderLayeringStrategy := ClassLoaderLayeringStrategy.Flat
// default
Test / classLoaderLayeringStrategy := ClassLoaderLayeringStrategy.ScalaLibrary
// enabled with turbo
Test / classLoaderLayeringStrategy := ClassLoaderLayeringStrategy.AllLibraryJars
```

- `ClassLoaderLayeringStrategy.Flat` includes all classes and JARs except for the Java runtime. The behavior of tasks using this strategy should be similar to forking without the overhead of starting a new jvm.
- `ClassLoaderLayeringStrategy.ScalaLibrary` creates a two-layer ClassLoader where Scala standard library is kept warm, similar to sbt 1.2.x
- `ClassLoaderLayeringStrategy.AllLibraryJars` creates a three-layer ClassLoader where library dependencies, in addition to Scala standard libraries are kept warm

`ClassLoaderLayeringStrategy.AllLibraryJars` should benefit the response time of run and test tasks. By caching the library jar classloader, the startup latency of the run and test tasks can be reduced significantly when they are run multiple times within the same session. GC pressure is also reduced because libraries jars will not be reloaded every time the task is evaluated.

**Note**: ClassLoaderLayeringStrategy.AllLibraryJars reuses the singleton object between the tests, which requires libraries to clean after itself.

`ClassLoaderLayeringStrategy.Flat` on the other hand will benefit certain applications that do not work well with layered ClassLoaders. One such example is Java serialization + serialization proxy pattern used by Scala collections.

ClassLoader layering was contributed by Ethan Atkins (@eatkins) as #4476


#### IO improvements

In addition to classloader layering, sbt 1.3.0 incorporates numerous performance enhancements including:

- faster recursive directory listing -- sbt internally uses a native library,
[swoval](https://github.com/swoval/swoval/blob/master/files/README.md), that
provides a jni interface to native os apis that allow for faster recursive
directory listing than the implementations in the java standard library.
- reduced latency of file change detection in continuous builds. In most cases
file events will trigger task evaluation within 10ms.

As of this writing sbt 1.3.0's edit-compile-test loop for 5000 source files is faster than that edit-compile-test with three source files using sbt 0.13, Gradle, and other build tools we tested (see [build
performance](https://github.com/eatkins/scala-build-watch-performance) for
details). These changes were contributed by Ethan Atkins (@eatkins).


#### Glob

sbt 1.3.0 introduces a new type, `Glob,` that describes a path search query. For example, all of the scala sources in the project directory can be described by `Glob(baseDirectory.value, RecursiveGlob / "*.scala")` or `baseDirectory.value.toGlob / ** / "*.scala",` where `**` is an alias for `RecursiveGlob`. Glob expands on [PathFinders](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Paths.html#Path+Finders) but they can be composed with no io overhead. Globs can be retrieved using a `FileTreeView`. For example, one can write:

```scala
val scalaSources = baseDirectory.value.toGlob / ** / "*.scala"
val javaSources = baseDirectory.value.toGlob / ** / "*.java"
val allSources = fileTreeView.value.list(Seq(scalaSources, javaSources))
```

and the `FileTreeView` will only traverse the base directory once. Globs and FileTreeView were added by Ethan Atkins ([@eatkins][@eatkins]) in [io#178](https://github.com/sbt/io/pull/178),[io#216](https://github.com/sbt/io/pull/216),[io#226](https://github.com/sbt/io/pull/226)

#### Watch improvements

sbt 1.3.0 introduces a new file monitoring implementation. It uses enhanced apis for tracking file change events using os events. It adds a new parser that extracts the specific task(s) for which it will monitor source files and rerun when it detects changes. Only source dependencies of the running tasks are monitored. For example, when running `~compile`, changes to test source files will not trigger a new build. Between file events, there are also now options to return to the shell, rerun the previous command(s) or exit sbt. These changes were implemented by Ethan Atkins ([@eatkins][@eatkins]) in [io#178](https://github.com/sbt/io/pull/178),[#216](https://github.com/sbt/io/pull/216),[#226](https://github.com/sbt/io/pull/226),[#4512](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4512),[#4627](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4627).

#### Build definition source watch

sbt 1.3.0 automatically watches the build definition sources and displays a warning
if you execute a task without reloading. This can be configured to reload automatically as follows:

```scala
Global / onChangedBuildSource := ReloadOnSourceChanges
```

This feature was contributed by Ethan Atkins ([@eatkins][@eatkins]) in [#4664][4664]

#### Custom incremental tasks

sbt 1.3.0 provides support to implement custom incremental tasks based on files.
Given a custom task that returns `java.nio.file.Path`, `Seq[java.nio.file.Path]`, `File`, or `Seq[File]`,
you can define a few helper tasks to make it more incremental.

```scala
import java.nio.file._
import scala.sys.process._
val gccCompile = taskKey[Seq[Path]]("compile C code using gcc")
val gccHeaders = taskKey[Seq[Path]]("header files")
val gccInclude = settingKey[Path]("include directory")
val gccLink = taskKey[Path]("link C code using gcc")

gccCompile / sourceDirectory := sourceDirectory.value
gccCompile / fileInputs += (gccCompile / sourceDirectory).value.toGlob / ** / "*.c"
gccInclude := (gccCompile / sourceDirectory).value.toPath / "include"
gccHeaders / fileInputs += gccInclude.value.toGlob / "*.h"
gccCompile / target := baseDirectory.value / "out"

gccCompile := {
  val objectDir = Files.createDirectories((gccCompile / target).value.toPath / "objects")
  def objectFile(path: Path): Path =
    target.value.toPath / path.getFileName.toString.replaceAll(".c\$", ".o")
  Files.createDirectories(target.value.toPath)
  val headerChanges = gccHeaders.inputFileChanges.hasChanges
  val changes = gccCompile.inputFileChanges
  changes.deleted.foreach(sf => Files.deleteIfExists(objectFile(sf)))
  val sourceFileChanges = changes.created ++ changes.modified
  val needRecompile = (sourceFileChanges ++ (if (headerChanges) changes.unmodified else Nil)).toSet

  val logger = streams.value.log
  gccCompile.inputFiles.map { sf =>
    val of = objectFile(sf)
    if (!Files.exists(of) || needRecompile(sf)) {
      logger.info(s"Compiling \$sf")
      s"gcc -I\${gccInclude.value} -c \$sf -o \$of".!!
    }
    of
  }
}
```

Given this setup, `gccCompile.inputFiles` will return a sequence of all of the input `c` source files, `gccCompile.inputFileChanges` returns a data structure containing the created, deleted, modified and unmodified files since the last run of `gccCompile` while `gccHeaders.changedInputFiles` returns the headers that have changed since the last run of `gccCompile`. Taken together, these tasks can be used to incrementally only rebuild the source files that need to be rebuilt given the file system changes since the last time gccCompile completed.

In another task such as `gccLink`, the result of `gccCompile` can be tracked as well using `gccCompile.outputFileChanges`.

```scala
gccLink := {
  val library = (gccCompile / target).value.toPath / "libmylib.dylib"
  val objectFiles = gccCompile.outputFiles
  val logger = streams.value.log
  if (!Files.exists(library) || gccCompile.outputFileChanges.hasChanges) {
    logger.info(s"Rebuilding \$library")
    s"gcc -dynamiclib -o \$library \${objectFiles mkString " "}".!!
  }
  library
}
```

The inputs of a task will automatically be monitored by the ~ command which has a new parser that is context aware. A custom clean task is also implemented for any task that generates file outputs. The clean tasks are aggregated across the project and config scopes. For example, Test / clean will clean all of the files generated by tasks in the Test config declared in the Test config but not the files generated in the Compile config.

This feature was contributed by Ethan Atkins (@eatkins) in #4627.

#### Super shell

When running in an ANSI-compatible terminal, sbt 1.3.0 will display the currently running tasks. This gives the developer the idea of what tasks are being processed in parallel, and where the build is spending its time. In homage to Gradle's "Rich Console" and Buck's "Super Console", we call ours "Super shell."

To opt-out put the following in the build:

```scala
ThisBuild / useSuperShell := false
```

or run sbt with `--supershell=false` (or `-Dsbt.supershell=false`). This feature was added by Eugene Yokota ([@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]) as [#4396][4396]/[util#196][util196].

#### Tracing

To view the task breakdown visually, run sbt with `--traces` (or `-Dsbt.traces=true`). This will generate `build.traces` file, which is viewable using Chrome Tracing `chrome://tracing/`. This feature was contributed by Jason Zaugg ([@retronym][@retronym]).

To output the task timings on screen, run sbt with `--timings` (or `-Dsbt.task.timings=true -Dsbt.task.timings.on.shutdown=true`).

#### SemanticDB support

sbt 1.3.0 makes it easier to generate [SemanticDB][SemanticDB]. To enable the generation of SemanticDB build-wide:

```
ThisBuild / semanticdbEnabled := true
ThisBuild / semanticdbVersion := "4.1.9"
ThisBuild / semanticdbIncludeInJar := false
```

This was added by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n] as [#4410][4410].

#### print command

sbt 1.3.0 adds a new `print` command, similar to `show` but prints directly to standard out.

```
# sbt -no-colors --error  "print akka-cluster/scalaVersion"
2.12.8
```

This was contributed by David Knapp ([@Falmarri][@Falmarri]) as [#4341][4341]

#### Appending Function1

`Function1` can be appended using `+=`.

```
Global / onLoad += { s =>
  doSomething()
  s
}
```

This was contributed by Dale Wijnand ([@dwijnand][@dwijnand]) as [#4521][4521].

#### JDK 11 support

sbt 1.3.0 is first release of sbt that's been testing on JDK11 extensively.
All integration tests on Travis CI are on AdoptOpenJDK's JDK 11, which were updated by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n] as [#4389][4389]/[zinc#639][zinc639]/[zinc640].

- Fixes warnings on JDK 9+ by upgrading to protobuf 3.7.0 [zinc#644][zinc644] by [@smarter][@smarter]
- Fixes spurious rebuilds caused by invalidation of `rt.jar` on JDK 11 [#4679][4679] by [@eatkins][@eatkins]

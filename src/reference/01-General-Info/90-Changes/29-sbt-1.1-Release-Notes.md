### sbt 1.1.4

#### Bug fixes

- Fixes triggered execution on macOS. See below for details.
- Fixes running `console` twice messing up JLine. [#3482][3482]/[#4054][4054] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Fixes `updateSbtClassifiers`. [#4070][4070]/[#3432][3432] by [@steinybot][@steinybot]
- Fixes Java error message handling. [zinc#524][zinc524]/[zinc#525][zinc525] by [@retronym][@retronym] and [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- Fixes the error message linking to the migration guide. [#4063][4063] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- Fixes batch script so sbt runs on JDK 10 on Windows. [lp#225][lp225] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Fixes bash script so `sbt -debug` changes log level to debug. [lp#226][lp226] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

#### Improvements

- Exposes `sbt.io.JavaMilli`. [io#139][io139] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- Adds `-Dsbt.launcher.cp.prepend` JVM flag that is used for monkey patching sbt. [launcher#50][launcher50] by [@fommil][@fommil]

#### Triggered execution on macOS

sbt has long had issues with triggered execution on macOS. Ethan Atkins has contributed a fix for this problem by merging MacOSXWatchService from his [CloseWatch][closewatch]. Thanks, Ethan!

Credit also goes to Greg Methvin and Takari's directory-watcher. [#3860][3860]/[#4071][4071]/[io#138][io138] by [@eatkins][@eatkins]

#### Running sbt with standby

One of the tricky things you come across while profiling is figuring out the process ID,
while wanting to profile the beginning of the application.

For this purpose, we've added `sbt.launcher.standby` JVM flag. Starting sbt 1.1.4, you can run:

```
\$ sbt -J-Dsbt.launcher.standby=20s exit
```

This will count down for 20s before doing anything else. [launcher#51][launcher51] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

#### Loading performance improvement

Using Flame graph (if you haven't yet, check out [Profiling JVM applications](../2018-04-09-profiling-JVM-applications/) post), Jason Zaugg identified hashing code of the build file to be one of the hot paths during sbt startup. Flame graph supports `Ctrl+F` to filter on method names; and when I ran it, it showed 4.5% of the time was spent in `Eval#evalCommon` method.

Instead of creating an intermediate `Array[Byte]` and passing it to `MessageDigest` at the end, Jason suggested that we pass the arrays to `MessageDigest#update` in a more procedural style. After confirming that it worked, we've next identified file timestamp code to be the next bottle neck using Flame graph, so that was switched to using NIO. After both changes, `Eval#evalCommon`'s footprint reduced to 2.3%.

This means that your build loads slightly faster on sbt 1.1.4 (about 0.54s faster on akka/akka, for example). [#4067][4067] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### sbt 1.1.1

#### Bug fixes

- Fixes "Modified names for (class) is empty" error. [zinc#292][zinc292] / [zinc#484][zinc484] by [@jvican][@jvican] (Scala Center)
- Fixes tab completion in `console` while running in batch mode as `sbt console`. [#3841][3841]/[#3876][3876] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Fixes file timestamp retrieval of missing files on Windows. [#3871][3871] / [io#120][io120] by [@cunei][@cunei]
- Aligns the errors thrown by file timestamp implementations. Fixes [#3894][3894] / [io#121][io121] by [@j-keck][@j-keck]
- Adds file timestamps native support for FreeBSD. [#3894][3894] / [io#124][io124] by [@cunei][@cunei]
- Fixes JDK 10 version string parsing. [sbt/sbt-launcher-package#209][launcher209] by [@2m][@2m]

#### Improvements

- Deprecates `Extracted#append` in favour of `appendWithSession` or `appendWithoutSession`.  [#3865][3865] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- Adds a new global `Boolean` setting called `autoStartServer`. See below.
- Upgrades Scala versions used for sbt cross building `^^`. [#3923][3923] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- Many documentation maintenance changes by [@xuwei-k][@xuwei-k].

#### autoStartServer setting

sbt 1.1.1 adds a new global `Boolean` setting called `autoStartServer`, which is set to `true` by default.
When set to `true`, sbt shell will automatically start sbt server. Otherwise, it will not start the server until `startSever` command is issued. This could be used to opt out of server for security reasons.

### sbt 1.1.0

This is a feature release for sbt 1.0.x series.

#### Features, fixes, changes with compatibility implications

- sbt server feature is reworked in sbt 1.1.0. See below.

#### Unified slash syntax for sbt shell and build.sbt

This adds unified slash syntax for both sbt shell and the build.sbt DSL.
Instead of the current `<project-id>/config:intask::key`, this adds
`<project-id>/<config-ident>/intask/key` where `<config-ident>` is the Scala identifier
notation for the configurations like `Compile` and `Test`. (The old shell syntax will continue to function)

These examples work both from the shell and in build.sbt.

    Global / cancelable
    ThisBuild / scalaVersion
    Test / test
    root / Compile / compile / scalacOptions
    ProjectRef(uri("file:/xxx/helloworld/"),"root")/Compile/scalacOptions
    Zero / Zero / name

The inspect command now outputs something that can be copy-pasted:

    > inspect compile
    [info] Task: sbt.inc.Analysis
    [info] Description:
    [info]  Compiles sources.
    [info] Provided by:
    [info]  ProjectRef(uri("file:/xxx/helloworld/"),"root")/Compile/compile
    [info] Defined at:
    [info]  (sbt.Defaults) Defaults.scala:326
    [info] Dependencies:
    [info]  Compile/manipulateBytecode
    [info]  Compile/incCompileSetup
    ....

#### sbt server

sbt server feature was reworked to use Language Server Protocol 3.0 (LSP) as the wire protocol, a protocol created by Microsoft for Visual Studio Code.

To discover a running server, sbt 1.1.0 creates a port file at `./project/target/active.json` relative to a build:

```
{"uri":"local:///Users/foo/.sbt/1.0/server/0845deda85cb41abcdef/sock"}
```

`local:` indicates a UNIX domain socket. Here's how we can say hello to the server using `nc`. (`^M` can be sent `Ctrl-V` then `Return`):

```
\$ nc -U /Users/foo/.sbt/1.0/server/0845deda85cb41abcdef/sock
Content-Length: 99^M
^M
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "initialize", "params": { "initializationOptions": { } } }^M
```

sbt server adds network access to sbt's shell command so, in addition to accepting input from the terminal, server also to accepts input from the network. Here's how we can call `compile`:

```
Content-Length: 93^M
^M
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "sbt/exec", "params": { "commandLine": "compile" } }^M
```

The running sbt session should now queue `compile`, and return back with compiler warnings and errors, if any:

```
Content-Length: 296
Content-Type: application/vscode-jsonrpc; charset=utf-8

{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"textDocument/publishDiagnostics","params":{"uri":"file:/Users/foo/work/hellotest/Hello.scala","diagnostics":[{"range":{"start":{"line":2,"character":26},"end":{"line":2,"character":27}},"severity":1,"source":"sbt","message":"object X is not a member of package foo"}]}}
```

#### VS Code extension

The primary use case we have in mind for the sbt server is tooling integration such as editors and IDEs. As a proof of concept, we created a Visual Studio Code extension called [Scala (sbt)][vscode-sbt-scala].

Currently this extension is able to:

- Run `compile` at the root project when `*.scala` files are saved. [#3524][3524] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Display compiler errors.
- Display log messages. [#3740][3740] by [@laughedelic][@laughedelic]
- Jump to class definitions. [#3660][3660] by [@wpopielarski][@wpopielarski]

#### Filtering scripted tests using `project/build.properties`

For all scripted tests in which `project/build.properties` exist, the value of the `sbt.version` property is read. If its binary version is different from `sbtBinaryVersion in pluginCrossBuild` the test will be skipped and a message indicating this will be logged.

This allows you to define scripted tests that track the minimum supported sbt versions, e.g. 0.13.9 and 1.0.0-RC2. [#3564][3564]/[#3566][3566] by [@jonas][@jonas]

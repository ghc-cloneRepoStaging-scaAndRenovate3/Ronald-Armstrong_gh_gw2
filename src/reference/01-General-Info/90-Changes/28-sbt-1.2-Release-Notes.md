## sbt 1.2.x releases

### sbt 1.2.1

#### Forward bincompat breakage

If you are writing a plugin, please use 1.2.1+, and avoid 1.2.0.

We unintentionally broke forward binary compatibility in 1.2.0.
If someone publishes an sbt plugin using sbt 1.2.0, it cannot be used from sbt 1.0.x or 1.1.x.
sbt 1.2.1 reverts the change, so the forward compatibility is restored.
Unfortunately, this means we won't be able to use varargs in `inThisBuild(...)` etc again.

Note that we might eventually break forward compatibility, like we did in 0.13.5 for `AutoPlugin`,
but only when the tradeoff is worth it.

#### The project Foo references an unknown configuration "bar"

Second regression fix is for the wall of warnings you might have seen in 1.2.0 that looks as follows:

```
[warn] The project ProjectRef(uri("file:/Users/xxx/work/akka/"), "akka-actor-typed") references an unknown configuration "multi-jvm" and was guessed to be "Multi-jvm".
[warn] This configuration should be explicitly added to the project.
[warn] The project ProjectRef(uri("file:/Users/xxx/work/akka/"), "akka-actor-typed-tests") references an unknown configuration "multi-jvm" and was guessed to be "Multi-jvm".
[warn] This configuration should be explicitly added to the project.
```

The original issue was that unified slash syntax doesn't pick the configuration names
when the configuration is not part of the subproject. Since this warning is immaterial,
we are removing them in this patch release.

One thing the plugin authors can start doing is declaring the custom configuration
as hidden, and adding them into the subprojects as follows:

```scala
import sbt._
import sbt.Keys._

object ParadoxPlugin extends AutoPlugin {
  val ParadoxTheme = config("paradox-theme").hide
  override def projectConfigurations: Seq[Configuration] = Seq(ParadoxTheme)

  ....
}
```

We are also looking into improving unified slash syntax parser to make it more robust.

#### Other bug fixes

- Updates `IO.relativize` for JDK 9. [io#175][io175] by [@eatkins][@eatkins]
- Fixes logic for adding external class file manager. [zinc#562][zinc562] by [@allanrenucci][@allanrenucci]

### sbt 1.2.0

**Warning**: We found forward compatibility breakage in 1.2.0, so we recommend everyone to upgrade to [sbt 1.2.1](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.2.1) or later.

The headline features of sbt 1.2 are cross JDK forking, composite project, and experimental thin clients. But, there are lots of other bug fixes and enhancements that we've been accumulating for six months since sbt 1.1.

#### SbtPlugin for plugin development

`SbtPlugin` is a plugin to declare a project for sbt plugins. This automatically brings in scripted tests, and sets `sbtPlugin := true`.

```scala
lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .enablePlugins(SbtPlugin)
```

**Compatibility note**: `ScriptedPlugin` is no longer a triggered plugin.

[#3875][3875] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

#### Cross JDK forking

For forked `run` and `test`, `java++` can now switch Java Home.

```
sbt:helloworld> run
[info] Running (fork) Hello
[info] 1.8.0_171
sbt:helloworld> java++ 10!
[info] Reapplying settings...
sbt:helloworld> run
[info] Running (fork) Hello
[info] 10.0.1
```

sbt will try to detect Java homes into `discoveredJavaHomes` setting, supporting [shyiko/jabba](https://github.com/shyiko/jabba). This can be augmented by `Global / javaHomes`:

```
Global / javaHomes += "6" -> file("/something/java-6")
```

This feature is intended for testing your library in an older JVM to check compatibility.

[#4139][4139] by [@2m][@2m], [@cunei][@cunei], and [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

#### scalaVersion-filtered aggregation

In 2015 James Roper [contributed](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-doge/pull/4) scalaVersion-filtered aggregation to sbt-doge. This feature is brought back into sbt 1.2 by Rui Gon√ßalves ([@ruippeixotog][@ruippeixotog]) in [#3698][3698]/[#3995][3995]!

This extends switch command `++` to take an optional `<command>`:

```
> ++2.12.7 compile
```

This will aggregate only the subproject where `++2.12.7` is valid, which is useful when you have a build where some subprojects are 2.11 only etc.

#### Composite project

sbt 1.2.0 introduces "composite project" trait, which allows plugin authors to generate subprojects, for example for cross building.

```
trait CompositeProject {
  def componentProjects: Seq[Project]
}
```

This was contributed by [@BennyHill][@BennyHill] as [#4056][4056].

#### Project matrix

**Experimental**. As a reference implementation of the `CompositeProject` I implemented a new DSL called `projectMatrix` introduced by [sbt-projectmatrix][projectmatrix] plugin.

```scala
lazy val core = (projectMatrix in file("core"))
  .scalaVersions("2.12.7", "2.11.12")
  .settings(
    name := "core"
  )
  .jvmPlatform()

lazy val app = (projectMatrix in file("app"))
  .dependsOn(core)
  .scalaVersions("2.12.7")
  .settings(
    name := "app"
  )
  .jvmPlatform()
```

The aim of the plugin is to support a generic notion of cross building (Scala version, platform, etc) expressed using subprojects. In the above `projectMarix` will produce three subprojects: `coreJVM2_12`, `coreJVM2_11`, and `appJVM2_12`.

#### Semantic Version selector API

sbt 1.2.0 introduces Semantic Version selector on `VersionNumber()` datatype supporting basic match, comparison (`<=`, `<`, `>=`, `>`), combination (`>1.0.0 <2.0.0`, `||`), ranges (`A.B.C - D.E.F`), and wildcard (`2.12.x`).

```scala
scala> import sbt.librarymanagement.{ VersionNumber, SemanticSelector }
import sbt.librarymanagement.{VersionNumber, SemanticSelector}

scala> VersionNumber("2.12.5").matchesSemVer(SemanticSelector(">=2.12"))
res1: Boolean = true

scala> VersionNumber("2.12.5").matchesSemVer(SemanticSelector("<2.12"))
res2: Boolean = false

scala> VersionNumber("2.13.0-M4").matchesSemVer(SemanticSelector("2.13"))
res3: Boolean = false

scala> VersionNumber("2.12.5").matchesSemVer(SemanticSelector("2.12.1 - 2.12.7"))
res4: Boolean = true

scala> VersionNumber("2.12.5").matchesSemVer(SemanticSelector("2.12.x"))
res5: Boolean = true

scala> VersionNumber("2.12.5").matchesSemVer(SemanticSelector("2.11.x || 2.12.x"))
res6: Boolean = true
```

**Note**: This has no effect on library management at the moment.

This was contributed by Rikito Taniguchi ([@tanishiking][@tanishiking]) as [lm#239][lm239].


#### addPluginSbtFile command

There's been a request from IntelliJ to safely inject a plugin to a build. sbt 1.2.0 adds `-addPluginSbtFile` command to do so.

```
\$ cat /tmp/extra.sbt
addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-assembly" % "0.14.7")

\$ sbt -addPluginSbtFile=/tmp/extra.sbt
...
sbt:helloworld> plugins
In file:/xxxx/hellotest/
  ...
  sbtassembly.AssemblyPlugin: enabled in root
```

Implmented by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n] as [#4211][4211].

#### Extensible sbt server

**Experimental**. sbt server can now be extended via the plugin.

```scala
    Global / serverHandlers += ServerHandler({ callback =>
      import callback._
      import sjsonnew.BasicJsonProtocol._
      import sbt.internal.protocol.JsonRpcRequestMessage
      ServerIntent(
        {
          case r: JsonRpcRequestMessage if r.method == "lunar/helo" =>
            jsonRpcNotify("lunar/oleh", "")
            ()
        },
        PartialFunction.empty
      )
```

This feature is still experimental and the API may change in the future.

[#3975][3975] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

#### Thin client(s)

**Experimental**. sbt 1.2.0 adds a new mode called `-client`. When sbt is started with -client command, it no longer to loads the build, and instead tries to connect to an instance of sbt server over JSON-RPC. When the server is not running (portfile is not found), it will fork a new instance of sbt entirely in a new JVM.

This lets you invoke `sbt` from the terminal shell or from an editor.

```
\$ time sbt -client clean

```

To end the server, call `sbt -client shutdown`. [#4227][4227] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

In addition, there are also an alternative thin clients [cb372/sbt-client](https://github.com/cb372/sbt-client) and [dwijnand/sbtl](https://github.com/dwijnand/sbtl) implemented using Rust.

Local Scala
-----------

To use a locally built Scala version, define the `scalaHome` setting,
which is of type `Option[File]`. This Scala version will only be used
for the build and not for sbt, which will still use the version it was
compiled against.

Example:

```scala
scalaHome := Some(file("/path/to/scala"))
```

Using a local Scala version will override the `scalaVersion` setting and
will not work with [cross building][Cross-Build].

sbt reuses the class loader for the local Scala version. If you
recompile your local Scala version and you are using sbt interactively,
run

```
> reload
```

to use the new compilation results.
